Functions defined by various sentences
Functions defined by various sentences can be defined with a Piecewise command
that provides an algebraic expression:
Piecewise (Cond1, F1, Cond2, F2, ..., Condn, FN, FOUTROS);
Where F1, F2, FN, FOUTROS are algebraic and Cond1, Cond2, ..., Cond are logical expressions.If
Cond1 is satisfied, the value of the expression F1 will be used;If cond2 is satisfied, the
F2 value;and so on.If no condition cond1, cond2, ..., condn is verified
And an optional expression has been defined, the value of this expression will be used.
